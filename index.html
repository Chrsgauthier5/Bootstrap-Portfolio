                    Hello! My name is Christopher Gauthier. Welcome to my page. Lets go over a little bit about me.
                    I was born in 1991 at Concord hospital and grew up in Henniker NH. This is the only Henniker on
                    earth
                    and
                    is home to local attractions
                    like Pats Peak, Sonny's Pizza & the Pancake House. As a child I attended the local elementary
                    school -
                    Henniker Community School.
                    After elementary school i attended
                    high school at John Stark Regional - this is located in Weare, NH which is the neighboring town to
                    henniker. I attended John Stark from 2006 - 2010.

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-bottom:100px;">
                <p>
                    I have a few random skills. The first one is being able to solve a rubik's cube. I learned this in
                    highschool to prove to myself that I could figure it out.
                    The second one is the ability to spin books &amp; binders (anything flat and normal sized) on my
                    finger. I
                    learned this while studying for the Series 7 examination while i was bored.
                    The final random skill I have is being able to juggle. I taught myself this from a juggling book.
                    (DISCLAIMER: I am not very good at juggling).

                    My thoughts on this project: This is challenging - CSS has been a lot of trial and error for me.
                    Sometimes
                    i think i understand what i am doing
                    but then a style i apply does not work or works in a different way. I am having fun learning more
                    each day!
